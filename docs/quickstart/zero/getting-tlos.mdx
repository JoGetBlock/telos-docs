# Funding Your Wallet

In our previous section, you got an account and wallet set up on the Telos Zero Network. In this section, we are going to discuss how to obtain TLOS tokens.

The TLOS token is both the governance and resource token of the Telos network and is used for voting on network-wide governance ballots, managing transaction quota and purchasing RAM.


## TLOS for Testnet

You can use the [Testnet Faucet](https://app.telos.net/testnet/developers?tab=tlos-native) to acquire Testnet TLOS. Enter your account name and press the `SEND TESTNET TLOS` button. Once completed, you will receive testnet funds to work with and write data to the blockchain.

### Bridging From Other Chains

TLOS is the native coin of the Telos blockchain (like ETH is for Ethereum, BNB is for Binance Smart Chain). TLOS now exists on three blockchains – Telos, Ethereum and BSC. While TLOS is fundamentally used on the Telos blockchain, it is also added on other blockchains for reasons such as liquidity and exposure. They’re pegged 1:1 which means that 1 TLOS on Telos is the same as 1 TLOS on Ethereum (erc20) and BSC (bep20). You can bridge/transfer TLOS between blockchains as per your convenience and needs.

[This article](/quickstart/zero/bridging/) describes the two primary methods used to bridge TLOS.

**Also visit the [Withdraw, Transfer, and Send TLOS](/quickstart/zero/withdraw-transfer-and-send-tlos) section for details on transferring TLOS between Zero and EVM.**
