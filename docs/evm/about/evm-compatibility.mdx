# EVM Compatibility

## Overview

The tEVM is generally compatible with any smart contract written in Solidity. Care must be taken to validate throughout the smart contract development life cycle that the contract is functioning as expected. It is always recommended to thoroughly test any contract on the Telos testnet before deploying to the Telos mainnet.

## Solidity Versions

Due to the nature of the Telos EVM's implementation, certain versions of Solidity may not always be supported. Currently, version 0.8.23 is fully supported and all versions before 0.8.23 should be supported, but version > 0.7.0 is recommended.

:::warning
Version 0.8.24 is partially supported. 0.8.24 can be used if the following functions are not called within the code: `tstore()`, `tload()`, `blobhash()`, `basefee()`, `blobbasefee()` and `mcopy()`

## Supported EIPs

As verified by [Sentnl's Audit](https://s3.eu-central-1.wasabisys.com/audit-certificates/Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20Certificate%20-%20Telos%20EVM.pdf) all gas values are consistent with gETH. An explicit effort was made to align the tEVM with EIP-2929 in order to conform with Gas costs. In addition to the Audit verification, all [Open-Zeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) tests have been run ensuring EVM compatibility.  
With the tEVM 1.5 upgrade, EIP-3855 is now supported.
