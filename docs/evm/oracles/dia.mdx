# DIA Price Oracles

## Ecosystem Price Oracles, powered by DIA

### Introduction to DIA 

**[DIA](https://diadata.org/)** is a cross-chain oracle provider that sources granular market data from diverse exchanges, including CEXs, DEXs, and NFT marketplaces. Its data sourcing is thorough, enabling unparalleled transparency and customizability for resilient price feeds for 20,000+ assets. Its versatile data processing and delivery ensures adaptability and reliability for any decentralized application.


### Usage of DIA Oracles on Telos

dApps building on Telos EVM can utilize DIA oracles to obtain up-to-date asset price information. These deployed oracles are suitable for use in production environments. They come with a list of supported assets and settings. However, if dApps require a custom oracle with a different set of assets and configurations, they should [contact DIA on Telegram](https://t.me/diabdteam).


### Deployed contracts

Access the oracles in the smart contracts below:

### Oracle configuration settings

Oracle specifications:


#### Methodology: VWAPIR

The final price point for each asset is calculated by computing the assets' trade information across multiple DEXs and CEXs. This is done using a Volume Weighted Average Price with Interquartile Range (VWAPIR) methodology. [Learn more about VWAPIR](https://docs.diadata.org/products/token-price-feeds/exchangeprices/vwapir-volume-weighted-average-price-with-interquartile-range-filter).


#### Update frequency: 0.2% deviation threshold, and 24 hour heartbeat.

The oracle operates a trade collection window of 2 minutes, distinct from the heartbeat mechanism. This period is used to aggregate trades for calculating the price point. Specifically, it gathers trade data within 120-second intervals and then evaluates if a 0.2% price deviation has occurred, triggering an update if such deviation is detected.


### How to access DIA oracles?

Here is an example of how to access a price value on DIA oracles:



1. Access your custom oracle smart contract on Telos.
2. Call `getValue(pair_name)` with `pair_name` being the full pair name such as `BTC/USD`. You can use the "Read" section on the explorer to execute this call.
3. The response of the call contains two values:
    1. The current asset price in USD with a fix-comma notation of 8 decimals.
    2. The UNIX timestamp of the last oracle update.

You can find DIA's oracle integration samples in Solidity and Vyper languages by visiting:
