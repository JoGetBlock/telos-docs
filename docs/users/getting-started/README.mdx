# Getting Started With Telos

Welcome to the Telos Ecosystem! Dive into this comprehensive guide to kickstart your journey. As the ecosystem evolves, so will this document, ensuring you always have up-to-date insights at your fingertips.

## An Introduction to The Telos Ecosystem

The Telos Ecosystem consists of two chains, Telos EVM and Telos Zero. Telos EVM is our world-class Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) and is the fastest EVM on the planet with a remarkable 15,200 transactions per second (TPS)—that's over 10,000% faster than Ethereum!
