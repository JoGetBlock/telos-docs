# How to add Telos ERC20 and BSC tokens to Trust Wallet

Tokens are Digital Assets created within the application on a certain blockchain. Trust Wallet supports several blockchains where tokens are being issued. When a token has been successfully sent to the wallet and it does not appear, it can be manually added as a Custom Token.
This guide shares screen-by-screen instructions to add Telos ERC20 and BSC tokens to the Trust Wallet app
