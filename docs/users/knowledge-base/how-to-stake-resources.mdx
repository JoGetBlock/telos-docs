# How To Stake Resources

In order to use the Telos Zero Network, you will need to stake some TLOS to CPU and Net. After doing this you will be able to transact for free on Telos Zero!

## Stake CPU & NET

:::info
This is not the staking done to earn rewards. Stake only the recommended amount. Staking resources will enable you to perform most of the actions on Telos. You do not need to do this again when you stake to REX in the future.
