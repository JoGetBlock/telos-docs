# How To Stake TLOS: A Simple Guide With FAQs

You can stake your TLOS coins and earn interest/returns/profits automatically compounded every 30 minutes. The rewards come from a community reserve and are distributed to those who stake their TLOS.

The process to stake TLOS is simple. You need to have TLOS on the Telos Blockchain to start.

In this guide, we will go over how to stake both on the Telos EVM, as well as on Telos Zero.

## How To Stake TLOS On The Telos EVM - Liquid Staking

When you stake your TLOS, you receive sTLOS which is a receipt token. sTLOS liquid staking allows you to remain flexible with your investments while enjoying staking rewards.  
If you don't have a wallet on Telos EVM, follow our guide [here](/users/getting-started/setup-wallet/).

:::tip
Please be aware that a 10-day unstaking timer is applied when removing your funds from sTLOS liquid staking. Once unstaked and sent to the underlying ESCROW contract, you will no longer be able to sell or transfer your tokens.
:::

We will be going over two different ways to stake your TLOS, using the Telos Web Wallet, and using Teloscan.  

Let's start with the recommended way, using Telos Web Wallet.

## Frequently Asked Questions:

### How do I create a free Telos Zero account?

If you don’t have a Telos account, follow this [guide](/users/getting-started/setup-wallet#setting-up-a-telos-wallet-account-telos-zero).

### What is REX and what does it mean to stake TLOS to REX?

REX stands for Resource Exchange. It meant lending and borrowing resources such as CPU and NET but is now a means to earn rewards.

### Where do the rewards for staking come from?

A community reserve pays for various purposes which include REX staking.

### Is staking 100% risk-free?
Yes, you are guaranteed 100% of your initial staking amount in TLOS.

### Is the rate of interest/APY fixed?

No, an allocation is set to the REX rewards pool from the community reserve. The rewards/APY you get depends on the total number of TLOS staked to REX and on the reward pool.

### Are the rewards automatically compounded?

Yes. TLOS starts to compound after a once-off stake.

### Can I unstake anytime?
Yes, a minimum of 4 days after staking for Telos Zero, and 10 days after staking for Telos EVM.

### I have my TLOS on Trustwallet/Metamask on Ethereum/BSC. How can I stake?

You will need to bridge your TLOS over to the Telos blockchain. Access a complete guide on how to bridge TLOS [here](/users/getting-started/bridging/).

### The wallet I’m using is not supported. How can I stake?
If your wallet has staking built-in (like SQRL), you can use that functionality. The other option is to import your Telos account to Anchor using the private keys, and then stake.
