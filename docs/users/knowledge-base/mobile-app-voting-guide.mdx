## Setting Up The App

Install the Decide Voter mobile app [here](https://decidevoter.app/)

Make sure you have Anchor Wallet installed on your Mobile phone and that the account(s) you intend to use is imported.

Open the Decide Voter app. Then click on the plus button to import the account by signing the transaction using Anchor mobile.

As the overall logic of the Telos Decide System also applies to the Decide Voter app, you now need to join the “Telos Governance Token”. This option will only be visible if you did not join the group previously. If you have not joined, you may still explore Telos Governance but voting will fail.

From here you must sign the transaction using Anchor wallet.
