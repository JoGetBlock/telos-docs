    Quickstart to setting up a node on the Telos Network!
title: "Nodes"
---

## [Telos EVM Docker](/nodes/non-bp-nodes/tevmc/)

The Telos EVM Docker lets you easily set up a local EVM node for development.

## [Telos EVM Pre-Synced Package](/nodes/non-bp-nodes/telos-evm-pre-synced-node/)

Starting the sync process for a Telos EVM node from the beginning can take several days and sometimes even weeks depending on the bandwidth and power of the system running the sync process. This pre-synced package should cut your sync time to 1 day or less by pre-syncing much of the chain data and offering it up as a download.

## [Block Producer](/nodes/bp-nodes/setting-up-telos-validator-nodes/)

Learn how to set up and run a block-producing node on Telos. Because Telos is a Delegated Proof Of Stake (DPOS) network, block producers have to be voted into the production schedule. Learn more about DPOS and the [Telos consensus mechanism](/overview/advanced/consensus/).
