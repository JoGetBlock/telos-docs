    Quickstart for using Alloy on Telos.
title: "Alloy"
---

[Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs) is a comprehensive Rust-based toolkit designed for interfacing applications with Ethereum-compatible blockchains. It offers a full suite of tools, including JSON-RPC client implementations, smart contract interaction, and network abstraction layers, all optimized for high performance and robustness.  

Alloy is a rewrite of [ethers-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs) from the ground up, with exciting new features, high performance, and excellent docs.

For more examples on using Alloy, see their official examples [here](https://github.com/alloy-rs/examples).

## Usage

To start using Alloy in your Rust project, add it to your Cargo.toml

``` rust
[dependencies]
alloy = { git = "https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy" }
```

## Setup

Next, you will need to configure your client with the desired network and transport layer.

``` rust
// 1. Import necessary modules from Alloy.
use alloy::ProviderBuilder;
use alloy_network::Network;

// 2. Set up your provider to connect to Telos Mainnet
// to connect to Telos Tesnet use https://testnet.telos.net
let provider = ProviderBuilder::new().connect("https://mainnet.telos.net").await?;
```

## Reading Data

Once your provider is configured, you can easily make RPC calls to fetch data from the blockchain.

``` rust
// Retrieve the latest block number.
let block_number = provider.get_block_number().await?;
```

## Writing Data

To write data to the blockchain, configure a Wallet provider and specify an account for transactions.

``` rust
use alloy::Wallet;
use alloy::ProviderBuilder;
use alloy_network::Ethereum;

let wallet = Wallet::new_from_private_key("your_private_key_here", &provider);
let signed_tx = wallet.send_transaction(tx_request).await?;
```

## Interacting With Smart Contracts

Alloy facilitates interaction with smart contracts through simple and intuitive methods. Start by creating a Contract instance.

``` rust
use alloy_contract::Contract;

let contract = Contract::new("contract_address_here", "contract_abi_here", &provider);

// Call a contract method.
let result = contract.method("methodName", (arg1, arg2)).call().await?;
```
