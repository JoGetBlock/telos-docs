# Introduction

## What is Telos?

Telos is a next-generation Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) Layer-1 blockchain network. It features unsurpassed compatibility for developers and provides an extensive suite of tools and onboarding support to develop and deploy smart contracts on the world's fastest, most scalable, and affordable Telos EVM. The network is backed by robust governance features and a vibrant community of passionate contributors and users excited about the future of Web3.

## Establishment

The Telos Network is a real-world-ready blockchain. Through years of challenges, innovation, and web3 firsts, Telos has grown into a network capable of supporting the extreme demands of the decentralized world of tomorrow. Launched in 2018 without an ICO and through a fair token distribution, the lead development team initially utilized the Antelope.io source code and debuted a specialized version with additional layers of governance, tooling, and node configuration requirements. Through the years, the development team has continued to innovate based on the needs of builders and, in late 2021, launched the first bespoke/ground-up Ethereum Virtual Machine (tEVM), which runs using a smart contract on the Telos Zero chain's quick finality and node infrastructure. The launch of the tEVM has given builders and users two networks, Telos Zero supporting C++-based applications and the tEVM allowing for complete compatibility from any traditional EVM/solidity-based applications. Telos continues to push beyond the boundaries of what web3.0 networks can achieve, and builders can look forward to additional performance and language capabilities as the Telos Network continues on its sharp growth trajectory.
